[![Install directly with Stylus](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install%20directly%20with-Stylus-00adad.svg)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/weakit/google-inter/master/google-inter.user.css)

Does one thing. Replaces the main font on Google Search (and other google sites, see sites) with Inter.

Preserves Product Sans for Logotypes.


## Why?

Roboto is fine, but it's getting kinda boring.

Furthermore, google has started experimenting with other fonts,
such as its Product Sans typeface, which looks fine for logotypes, but doesn't
render nicely a lot and doesn't look very nice on smaller point sizes.

Inter is a very well designed typeface, and is easily legible in smaller sizes.
